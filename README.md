# super-simple-jpg-compressor
The most basic JPG compressor I could come up with, using pillow antialiasing. Built in file extension check to avoid errors on PNG or other filetype input.

## Dependencies
Python PIL (pillow) library, Python tkinter library (default on most environments), and of course Python3. Will not work with Python2.

```pip install PIL```

## Usage
Download or clone file to your local system. CD into the directory.

```cd /super-simple-jpg-compressor/```

Run in Python interpreter 

```python main.py```

If on macOS, you might need to specify Python version.

```python3 main.py```

Use the GUI to pick an input image, then, when prompted, use the GUI to save the file to output.
